# PR04_bcn_restaurants

This project has been developed by Xabi Lopez and Carlos Azagra, 2 colleagues from Data analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack Barcelona.

## Description

We wanted to create a dashboard that enables the user to get centralized information from Barcelona restaurants. Visually clean and easy to play with, this dashbord is the perfect tool not only for end-consumers who are looking for a place to have a meal in the city, but also for companies that need to analyse information related to this topics. 

## Databases

The information that we are providing with this tool is robust. We have obtained all the data from 3 different reliable resources:
- Open Data BCN: downloading the .csv they provide with all the public information
- Coca Cola: obtaining they data by a query in company ERP (no sensitive data/information)
- El Tenedor: web scrapping from the website

## Workflow
1. Information obtained by using Python (pandas and Selenium)
2. 4 Databases created and uploaded to DB Browser to join them in only one table by using a SQL Query
3. Develope the tool in PowerBI

## Dashboard

You can find the final result in the file App_RestBCN


We hope you enjoy playing with it.
